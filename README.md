# avocado-price-prediction
These Jupyter Notebooks are developed through my Artificial Intelligence specialization at uni. The two notebooks committed are __Python-based__. The __Avocado Price Prediction - EDA Final__ contains the general EDA-ing, and the second one â€“ __Modeling Notebook__ is for the prediction phase of the project in which I used Regression and SARIMAX modeling.
